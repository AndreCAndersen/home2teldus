Integration between Google Home and Telldus Live

Because Telldus Live (as of February 4th 2020) no longer supports IFTTT, 
I'm building this interface  in order to still be able to give Google Home 
commands to my devices connected to Telldus Live.

Because if I don't, all the devices I have bought for it are useless.

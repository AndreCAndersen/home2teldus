Integration between Google Home and Telldus Live

Because Telldus Live (as of February 4th 2020) no longer supports IFTTT, 
I'm building this interface in order to still be able to give Google Home 
commands to my devices connected to Telldus Live.

If I didn't make this tool, all the devices I have bought for Telldus Live
would have been useless.

See [home2telldus.herokuapp.com](https://home2telldus.herokuapp.com/) for API 
documentation, instructions and limitations.
